	<description>Vanilla Cooking Expanded - Sushi is the second sub-module to the new Vanilla Cuisine Expanded mod series. This particular mod introduces sushi - a fish and rice based food that is immensely popular on the Rim.

The module is an amazing way to make good use of our fishing mod, since all sushi meals need fish. It also includes two new plants, wasabi and soybeans, and two new condiments extracted from them: wasabi paste and soy sauce. Soy sauce needs to be fermented, and its quality will increase with time, in case you decide to use it as a "cash crop".

And of course you can always deep fry your sushi.</description>
